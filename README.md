Web app manifests are part of a collection of web technologies called progressive web apps (PWAs), 
which are websites that can be installed to a deviceâ€™s homescreen without an app store. Unlike regular web apps with simple homescreen links or bookmarks, 
PWAs can be downloaded in advance and can work offline, as well as use regular Web APIs. -  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest
